# MySQLWrapper
This is a wrapper class for `.NET Framework 4.7.2` to use an `SQL` data base with [MySqlConnector](https://mysqlconnector.net/).<br>
It provides functions for all types of sql statements and a function for setting integer that also calculates the existing integer with it.

# LanguageManager
This is a small translation system that has a default or system language and can also handel individual user languages at the same time.
You can use translations by a string identifier for multiple languages.
